# AskHerOut.js 🌹

## 📖 Description

**AskHerOut.js** is a simple JavaScript app that adds a creative twist to asking someone out. Instead of a direct approach, the app engages them in a fun game, allowing for a memorable and unique experience.

## 💡 How It Works

The app uses a simple JavaScript function to ask a question using the `prompt` function. Based on the answer provided, it displays a corresponding message using `console.log`. The messages can be customized to suit your style and personality.

## 🎈 Customization

Feel free to customize **AskHerOut.js** to make it even more special:

- Edit the prompt question and messages in the JavaScript code to add your personal touch.
- Customize the styling and appearance of the app by modifying the HTML and CSS files.
